A quick Geolocation library wrapper. Currently implements Geoplugin.net, IPInfoDB and MaxMind GeoIP City Lite. The main class is Geolocator.php:Geolocator.

Other files:
  Geolibrary.php is the parent of the library classes.
  libraries/* is the implementation for the geolocation services.

Configuration:
  Geoplugin.net would appreciate if you registered your site if you use their API.
  IPInfoDB requires an API key, specified in libraries/Ipinfodb.php.
  MaxMind GeoIP City Lite requires a GeoIP database downloaded from Maxmind and a path to it specifeid in libraries/Maxmind_city.php.
  If you don't specify either of these things, those two APIs will both fail and only Geoplugin.net will work.
